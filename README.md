Fuck teachers who give "vocab" lists and make us look for the vocab. I'm done with it . This program allows you to input a list and get definitions. Keys to API can be found @ dictionaryapi.com for free.

Usage:
Run program, input a list (numbers and periods are OK), enter -1 when done.

Will output Marrian-Webster definitions.

Must edit where you find $key and hardcode it into source cuz I'm lazy.
